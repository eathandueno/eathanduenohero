        About Eathan Dueno
    </h1>
    <p class="intro alert">
        I am currently attending College of Western Idaho studying Software Development. On top of that I enrolled at Coding Dojo where I have started learning full-stack software development. After my time in the military I became very fond of Software development and the tech industry. My time really taught me to have attention to detail, leading and high stress environment management. In my free time I enjoy working out, playing video games and going on hikes. I recently started studying to take the NASM-Certified Personal Trainer certificate, so that I can have my own general understanding of the sciences behind exercise and for a part time job while attending school.

    <p class="alert">
        For <strong>two years</strong>  I served in active duty military as an Aircraft Mechanic on the KC-10. I then transferred to the Air National Guard for one year to work on the A-10. After all that I worked at Lionbridge Technologies where I wrote and assisted in the removal of bugs in a multimillion dollar game.
