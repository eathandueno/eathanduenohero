        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>
            After my time in the military I became very fond of Software development and the tech industry. My time really taught me to have attention to detail, leading and high stress environment management. In my free time I enjoy working out, playing video games and going on hikes. I recently started studying to take the NASM-Certified Personal Trainer certificate, so that I can have my own general understanding of the sciences behind exercise and for a part time job while attending school.

            I am currently attending College of Western Idaho studying Software Development and plan on finishing within the <b>next year and a half</b> . On top of that I completed full stack program focused on the Flask framework at Coding Dojo. While attending school I have been very proactive in my software development career attempting to self-teach my way through the M.E.R.N. framework. With that I plan on building some websites for my portfolio as well as make attempts at pursuing my entrepreneurial goals.
